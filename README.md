# Shiftlock Solitaire

An homage to a masterpiece of a solitaire game originally designed by Peter
Scholtz and released in 2024 by Wise Wizrd Games.  For rules refer to https://www.wisewizardgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Sherlock_Rulesheet.pdf

The Crime Scene and Shiftlock's Office (up to 48 cards) fit on an 80x24 screen on
a VIC-II or TED Commodore computer from the 1980s.

Requires the 64TASS assembler to build. Supports the following platforms already

* Commodore 64, SX-64

* Commodore Plus/4, 16

* Commodore P500, CBM 510 (not currently building correctly due to odd behavior of RAM installed in bank 15 beyond $0400 to $07ff)

Wise Wizard holds all rights to this card game, which you should purchase to
support the original creator.  Neither entity was involved with Shiftlock Solitaire,
whose author disclaims any rights to the property it is based on.  He merely
taught his Commodore collection how to let him play it onscreen.
